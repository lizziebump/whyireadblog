              <p>Do you ever read a book and then come out the other side feeling like you’re smarter? Louis de Bernières has an incredible talent for telling romantic and nostalgic stories that are set against a relatively unknown historical backdrop. What these historical backdrops tend to have in common is that, while your typical Westerner kind of knows that they happened, I’d be pretty sure that they wouldn’t be sure of the in-depth details of said event. <span class="read-more">Read more.</span></p>

              <p>The long answer: much more complicated, deep, and requires a rambling answer which of course, I’m happy to go into. <span class="read-more">Read more.</span></p>

            <div class="post-copy">
              <p>I’ve been toying with the idea of a book blog for a while now. Each time I finish a story, a part of me feels fit to burst and I want to discuss what I’ve just read with anyone who’ll care to listen. The most frustrating part though (but also something that’s pretty magical about reading a book) is that no one is sharing that story with you in the exact same moments as when you’re reading it. Then by the time I’ve badgered my friends into reading the same story as me and they’re ready to discuss it, I can never quite summon that fresh enthusiasm back. <span class="read-more">Read more.</span></p>
