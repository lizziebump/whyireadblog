        <h1>Birds Without Wings</h1>
        <h2>by Louis de Bernières</h2>
        <div class="post-copy">
          <p>Do you ever read a book and then come out the other side feeling like you’re smarter? Louis de Bernières has an incredible talent for telling romantic and nostalgic stories that are set against a relatively unknown historical backdrop. What these historical backdrops tend to have in common is that, while your typical Westerner kind of knows that they happened, I’d be pretty sure that they wouldn’t be sure of the in-depth details of said event.</p>

          <p>What de Bernières manages to do in Birds Without Wings is simultaneously educate you about hundreds of years of ethnic conflict in the Balkans, while detailing the fictional lives, loves and losses of a number of villagers living in the obscure town of Eskibahçe - which starts out as the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the novel, and ends up as Turkey.</p>

          <p>This book is the precursor to de Bernières’ magnum opus, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin. I read this a couple of years ago - in fact it was the first novel I read after finishing my undergrad degree so I always feel a warm nostalgia for it, remembering it dearly as the book that coaxed me back into reading. While Birds Without Wings doesn’t leave you with the same kind of longing and heartache (seriously, I felt a deep ache of frustration in the pit of my stomach when I finished CCM) - it still manages to give you a violent shove into sentimentality.</p>

          <p>At the end I was convinced that the future of mankind was doomed to repeat the past mistakes of our ancestors. I also had a heavy and inescapable feeling that war was inevitable albeit completely pointless and unfair.</p>

          <p>Alongside this I had a terrific urge to board the next flight to Turkey and wander around the areas in which the novel is set to find out as much about the history there as feasibly possible. Needless to say I did nothing of the sort, but I did find myself googling Mustafa Kemal and wishing that I’d taken a few modules at uni on Turkey so that I could be a certified expert by now. I also found myself glumly wondering about the real Christian refugees that had been forcibly removed from Turkey and ordered to start their lives again in Greece.</p>

          <p>Overall? This was a good un. Would recommend. And don’t be put off and expect that it’s all doom and gloom. Some parts genuinely made me laugh out loud. de Bernières has a sharp knack for making sweeping statements that characterise entire groups of people in a wonderfully positive and endearing way. Sounds potentially offensive, but it really isn’t. Go read it if you’ve got approximately 5 full days to spare, cos it’s a bit of a beast in terms of length (but worth the investment).<p>
