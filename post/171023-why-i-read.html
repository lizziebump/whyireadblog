        <h1>Why I read</h1>
        <div class="post-copy">
          <p>The short answer: because my Mum told me to.</p>
          <p>The long answer: much more complicated, deep, and requires a rambling answer which of course, I’m happy to go into.
          <p>From as early as I can remember, reading has been a part of my identity. People at school used to pull my pigtails and call me ‘boffin’ which I, being sure of myself as a chubby little geek, used to assume the role of quite happily. Whenever grown-ups would describe me as a bookworm, I remember feeing quite a sense of pride that my most treasured hobby in life had been acknowledged and was given the adult stamp of approval. As a small child that always wanted to be well liked by adults (but didn’t really give two hoots about whether or not the snot-faced kids in my class liked me), I think I played into this role of always having a book under my nose.</p>
          <p>Does anyone else remember those library challenges that we used to get set every summer? The Reading Maze, The Reading Rollercoaster - you used to have to go to the library and borrow 6 books over the summer holidays, then read and review them. I used to pursue this challenge with delight, and would use it as an excuse to badger my poor Mum to take me to the library every weekend.</p>
          <p>I think about this a lot now, and wish it was still socially acceptable for me to turn up to exhausting social occasions with a book in hand so that I could sit quietly at the table and read my book while ignoring the conversation everyone else was having around me. For some unfair reason, when a child does this it’s seen as exceptionally good behaviour. When an adult does this it’s seen as exceptionally rude. How I miss childhood.</p>
          <p>My favourite two authors as a child were, without doubt, Roald Dahl and Jacqueline Wilson. As I’ve grown up, Jacqueline Wilson has stayed firmly in my childhood but Roald Dahl still exists as (most probs) my fave of all time. There’s something magical about the way he tells a story. His sinister yet hilariously funny tales, his witty turns of phrase, his use of magic, his creation of female child protagonists (I always liked to think I was basically Matilda..). I love that for Roald Dahl, women could be funny, charming, terrifying, powerful, strong, provocative. And I’ve realised that his adult short stories are just as pleasing as the books I devoured when I was younger.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, when I reached the age of about 16 I stopped reading. I can attribute this to a number of things. Firstly, social media really began to take off. In 2010, everyone was turning to Facebook and Twitter. This was the year that I got an iPhone and in my spare time I’d resort to reading inane tweets and texts rather than reading a book. It was also the year I discovered my second passion - politics - and for a while, this took centre stage.</p>
          <p>Then a couple of years later I went off to University where I was forced to read. But this wasn’t the world of fiction - I did an International Relations degree and the books I read - while incredibly interesting, served a different purpose for me. Philosophical texts and international relations theory filled my reading lists, and in any spare moment I had I couldn’t think of anything less appealing than picking up another book.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to 2015 when I had the realisation that I hadn’t read a fiction book in 5 years. This resulted in a mild identity crisis and utter loss of knowing where to start when picking up new books. The last time I’d been reading, I’d been absorbed in the world of young adult fiction. My favourite book series was Harry Potter and everyone and their Nan was obsessed with the Twilight series. I knew I didn’t want to go back to this, but had no idea where to start in the world of ‘literature for grown-ups’.</p>
          <p>So over the past few years I’ve been undergoing a sort of crash course. Attempting to devour the classics (Great Expectations, Wuthering Heights, Pride & Prejudice etc etc), some cult icons (A Clockwork Orange, 100 Years of Solitude, A Scanner Darkly), some feminist fiction (I Love Dick, NW, The Edible Woman) among others, with the idea of understanding what it is that I like now that I’m old enough to have opinions on this kind of thing (apparently).</p>
          <p>What I’ve started to understand about myself is that I often find classics dry and overrated. Call me controversial but attempting to translate a dense and dreary 1000 word passage that contains an unlimited number of commas and just one full stop - not my favourite pastime. I’m also, by this point, systematically bo000oo00red of the fact that the ‘canon’ of almost every genre is male-dominated. Bore me later.</p>
          <p>However, I’m also very much of the view that I can’t criticise something until I’ve forced myself to consume it. So you might see that there’s a lot of self-inflicted frustration and hair-pulling on the horizon.</p>
          <p>So what was the point of this post again? Oh yeah - why I read. I guess the answer is, because it’s who I am. Because it distracts me from my anxious brain. Because it calms me. Because it opens me up to new ideas. Because it makes me more compassionate. Because it improves my patience. Because I get to discover whole new worlds that I never knew existed. And because I bloody love the smell of a musty old book.<p>
