        <h1>An introduction</h1>
        <div class="post-copy">
          <p>I’ve been toying with the idea of a book blog for a while now. Each time I finish a story, a part of me feels fit to burst and I want to discuss what I’ve just read with anyone who’ll care to listen. The most frustrating part though (but also something that’s pretty magical about reading a book) is that no one is sharing that story with you in the exact same moments as when you’re reading it. Then by the time I’ve badgered my friends into reading the same story as me and they’re ready to discuss it, I can never quite summon that fresh enthusiasm back.</p>
          <p>The problem is simply this: that moment when you finish a book is always so temporary. I finish and am filled to the brim with emotion, be it frustration at how rubbish the ending was or longing for the next chapter that hasn’t been written (yet). A few days pass and I can’t seem to remember exactly how that book made me feel. My thoughts are reduced down to - oh I liked that one. Or - god, the protagonist in that one was insufferable. What I need is a journal, some kind of catalogue that captures those thoughts that spring to you in those vital moments just after you’ve read that last sentence. So that’s what I intend to use this for.</p>
          <p>This is a mood capture. How did that book make me feel. Why did I like it. Why did I hate it.</p>
          <p>First off, don’t hold me to it. I have a terrible track record for coming up with ideas that will make me a better and more productive person and then failing to implement them. And yes, I’m already justifying giving up on this project which bodes well, doesn’t it?</p>
          <p>Second, don’t expect me to be some kind of ground-breaking literary critic with an effortless knack for writing. That ain’t me. And that’s not what this is for. And right now I’m writing this with the prospect of no one ever reading this and now I’m babbling (case in point).</p>
